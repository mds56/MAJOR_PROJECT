Title of the Project : GAMING APPLICATION FOR ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE DETECTION

Project Idea :

An android application has been proposed that provides various tests in the form of levels of a
game to detect whether a person suffers from Alzheimer’s or not and also tells them the degree 
of the disease i.e. Mild, Moderate, Severe which helps to track the status of the patient also.

Modules included in our project:

1) Registration with OTP
2) Designing various games
3) Analyse the level of disease


Conclusion and Future Scope:

People never prefer to visit a doctor until the symptoms get intensified, which generally happens
in the later stages of the disease. CT scans, MRI scans, and PET scans are performed when prescribed
by the doctor only. Hence diagnosing the disease and providing the proper medication for the patient
in the early stages of disease, will help in preventing the serious effects caused by the disease in
later stages. The mobile application developed will help to diagnose the disease in the early stage 
by playing the games.

Along with diagonizing of disease, we can provide games to improve the patient’s thinking skills and 
memory power. We can extend the application by providing the medication for the disease,and by helping 
the patient to get doctor appointments in the required situations.
